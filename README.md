In the video, I briefly introduce Tkinter and then cover fundamentals such as:

- Sizing it to desired dimensions

- Configuring window with its own icon

I also touch on the basics of adding a new label and button into Gui application, as well as show how we can create a new Python function that changes the text of our label with each button click.
